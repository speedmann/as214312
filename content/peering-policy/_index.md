# AS214312 Peering Policy

**Policy Overview:**  
AS214312 welcomes peering with any network that is interested in establishing a BGP session. We believe in an open and collaborative internet and are happy to peer with networks of all sizes, across any geographical location.

2. **BGP Session:**  
   Peering is conducted via BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

3. **Prefix Filtering:**  
   We expect peers to implement reasonable prefix filtering to ensure the stability and security of the network.

4. **No Minimum Traffic Requirement:**  
   There is no minimum traffic requirement to peer with AS214312. We encourage peering for both large and small networks.

5. **Contact Information:**  
   Peering requests can be initiated by reaching out via email (peering@as214312.de) or by connecting with us on [PeeringDB](https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/214312).
